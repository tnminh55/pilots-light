I knew from that moment I was being called to be a personal soul winner- not just\r\n                    preaching from the pulpit(which is easy) but talking to people face to face(which is not easy)\r\n                    the funny thing is, only a few days before, I had asked Arthur to pray for me that I could have his anointing. I knew he had something i didn't have-and I wanted it. I honestly in my vestry of Westminster Chapel Arthur laid his hands on me that I might have his anointing.\r\n                    not long ago I was Arthur's guest on TBN. we were discussing my book These are the Days of Elijah.in the course of that interview Arthur asked,\"R.T, what do you do when people ask for your anointing,like when Elisha asked for Elijah's mantle?\" I replied:\"well, Arthur,to be honest I actually did that-don't you remember? In my vestry at Westminster Chapel that is exactly what I asked from you?\" yes, he remembered.then I asked a question I had not thought\r\n                    of until that moment:\"Was that prayer answered?\" I thought for a few seconds. YES. Arthur'prayer was answered. First, our Pilot Light Ministry(witnessing on the streets in\r\n                    westminster between Victoria and Buckingham Palace) was born a few days later. Over the next twenty years we had hundreds of people from mamy nations of the world pray to receive Christ.\r\n                    (some even went into ministry). By the way, Bob George was the first to join us on the streets.\r\n                    Before he went to heaven(over twenty years later) he had over 500 to pray to receive Christ.\r\n                    He made up for lost time. second, my onwn life was never the same again. Apart from people\r\n                    praying to receive the lord on the step of westminster Chapel, I have been an evangelist wherever gone over the past thirty years- on trains, planes and automobiles- everywhere.\r\n                    Arthur's anointing did truly fall on me. I am surprised I had not seen this before.I don't carry a cross.I don't preach in jeans. Or give out jesus stickers.But I have had many hundreds pray with me to receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.\r\n\r\n                    What about you? Have you ever led a soul to Christ? I challenge you- make it a goal to Lead\r\n                    at least one soul to the Lord. A small suggestion: try to do it soon. The months will fly by.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default History\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport './Footer.css'\r\n\r\nconst Footer = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n            <div className=\"footer-container\">\r\n                <div className='footer-items'>\r\n                    <h2>Contact Us</h2>\r\n                    <p>How it Works</p>\r\n                    <p>Testimonials</p>\r\n                    <p>Meeting</p>\r\n                    <p>Signed Up</p>\r\n                    <p>Term of Service</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='footer-items'>\r\n                    <h2>About Us</h2>\r\n                    <p>How it Works</p>\r\n                    <p>Bible studies</p>\r\n                    <p>Service</p>\r\n                    <p>Blog</p>\r\n                    <p>Term of Service</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='footer-items'>\r\n                    <h2>About Us</h2>\r\n                    <p>How it Works</p>\r\n                    <p>Witnessing</p>\r\n                    <p>Online Church</p>\r\n                    <p>Life Groups</p>\r\n                    <p>Term of Service</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <small className='small-logo'>Pilot Light<i className=\"fas fa-bible\" /></small>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Footer","import React from 'react'\r\nimport Footer from './Footer'\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction home() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <Footer />\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default home\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport './Testimonials.css'\r\n\r\nconst Testimonials = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"testi-section\">\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h3 className=\"testimonies\">Testimonies</h3>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"box-container\">\r\n                <div className=\"box-content\">\r\n                    <img src=\"/images/Ruth.jpg\"></img>\r\n                    <img src=\"/images/victoria.jpg\"></img>\r\n                    <img src=\"/images/cathedral.jpg\"></img>\r\n                    <img src=\"/images/coffeeshop.jpg\"></img>\r\n                    <img src=\"/images/prayer.jpg\"></img>\r\n                </div >\r\n                <p className=\"paragraph\">RUTH TESTIMONY: john was so anti-God very angry with organised religion the bible.\r\n                    However I persistently told him that even though he hate God, but still God loves him.\r\n                    He said he had a few near death experience.
